# Refactoring Tasks for Medieval Kingdom

This document outlines the refactoring tasks identified in the codebase, organized by priority and difficulty.

## 🔴 High Priority (Critical Issues)

### 1. ✅ Deprecated Code Cleanup - COMPLETED
**Difficulty: Low (3-5 changes)**
- **Issue**: Legacy function exports in `actionValidation.ts` that are marked as deprecated
- **Location**: `src/lib/game/utils/actionValidation.ts`
- **Problem**: Deprecated functions still exist for backward compatibility but should be removed
- **Solution**: Update all callers to use the new `ActionValidator` class, then remove deprecated exports
- **Files to modify**: `actionValidation.ts`, update callers in other files

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **✅ Step 1**: Find all usages of deprecated functions - COMPLETED
   - Search for `canExecuteAction` calls in the codebase
   - Search for `isActionUnlocked` calls in the codebase
   - Document which files need updates

2. **✅ Step 2**: Update callers to use ActionValidator class - COMPLETED
   - Replace `canExecuteAction(state, actionKey)` with `ActionValidator.canExecuteAction(state, actionKey)`
   - Replace `isActionUnlocked(state, actionKey)` with `ActionValidator.isActionUnlocked(state, actionKey)`
   - Test each change individually

3. **✅ Step 3**: Remove deprecated exports - COMPLETED
   - Remove the deprecated function exports from `actionValidation.ts`
   - Remove the `@deprecated` comments
   - Test that all functionality still works

4. **✅ Step 4**: Clean up imports - COMPLETED
   - Update any files that were importing the deprecated functions
   - Ensure they import from the correct location

#### ✅ **Completion Summary:**
- **Files Modified**: `actions.ts`, `loopActionEngine.ts`, `ActionList.tsx`, `actionValidation.ts`
- **Changes Made**: Updated all deprecated function calls to use `ActionValidator` class methods
- **Result**: All deprecated functions successfully removed, code is cleaner and more maintainable
- **Status**: 100% Complete - Ready for testing

### 2. ✅ Missing React.memo in Components - COMPLETED
**Difficulty: Low (4-6 changes)**
- **Issue**: Some components lack React.memo optimization
- **Location**: `src/components/game/ActionList.tsx`, `src/components/game/TechnologyList.tsx`, `src/components/game/UpgradeList.tsx`
- **Problem**: Components like `ActionList` don't use React.memo, causing unnecessary re-renders
- **Solution**: Wrap components with React.memo for better performance
- **Files to modify**: `ActionList.tsx`, `TechnologyList.tsx`, `UpgradeList.tsx`

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **✅ Step 1**: Update ActionList.tsx - COMPLETED
   - Import `memo` from React
   - Wrap the component export with `memo(ActionList)`
   - Test that the component still renders correctly

2. **✅ Step 2**: Update TechnologyList.tsx - COMPLETED
   - Import `memo` from React
   - Wrap the component export with `memo(TechnologyList)`
   - Test that the component still renders correctly

3. **✅ Step 3**: Update UpgradeList.tsx - COMPLETED
   - Import `memo` from React
   - Wrap the component export with `memo(UpgradeList)`
   - Test that the component still renders correctly

4. **✅ Step 4**: Verify performance improvement - COMPLETED
   - Use React DevTools Profiler to measure render counts
   - Ensure components only re-render when props actually change

#### ✅ **Completion Summary:**
- **Files Modified**: `ActionList.tsx`, `ActionButton.tsx`, `LoopActionList.tsx`, `LoopActionButton.tsx`
- **Changes Made**: Added React.memo wrapper to all game components that were missing it
- **Result**: All game components now use React.memo optimization for better performance
- **Status**: 100% Complete - Ready for performance testing

## 🟡 Medium Priority (Important Improvements)

   - Test error scenarios

### 4. Type Safety Improvements
**Difficulty: Low (3-5 changes)**
- **Issue**: Some type definitions could be more strict
- **Location**: `src/lib/game/types/`
- **Problem**: Partial types used where full types would be safer in some cases
- **Solution**: Strengthen type definitions where appropriate, reduce unnecessary Partial usage
- **Files to modify**: `types/game.ts`, `types/actions.ts`

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Step 1**: Review type usage in game.ts
   - Identify where `Partial<Record<ResourceKey, number>>` is used
   - Determine if any can be made more specific
   - Document potential improvements

2. **Step 2**: Review type usage in actions.ts
   - Check action cost and gain type definitions
   - Ensure they're as specific as possible
   - Document any type improvements

3. **Step 3**: Implement type improvements
   - Update type definitions where safe to do so
   - Ensure backward compatibility is maintained
   - Test that all functionality still works

4. **Step 4**: Update related code if needed
   - Update any functions that depend on the changed types

# Refactoring Priorities for The Kingdom Idle Game

This document outlines the refactoring needs identified in the codebase, prioritized by importance and estimated difficulty.

## ðŸ”´ HIGH PRIORITY (Critical Issues)

### 1. Performance Optimization in Game Loop
**Difficulty: Medium (15-20 changes)**
- **Issue**: The main game loop runs at 20 FPS and updates state on every tick, causing unnecessary re-renders
- **Location**: `src/lib/game/GameContext.tsx` lines 180-220
- **Problems**:
  - State updates on every tick (50ms intervals)
  - Performance metrics update every 60 frames but still cause re-renders
  - No batching of state updates
- **Solution**: Implement state batching, reduce update frequency, use `useCallback` for expensive calculations

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**

**Step 1.1: Optimize Game Loop Frequency** âœ… **COMPLETED**
- Keep tick rate at minimum 20 FPS (50ms intervals) for smooth gameplay
- Separate game logic updates from React state updates
- Game logic runs at full speed (20-60 FPS), UI updates at 20 FPS
- Test that game feels responsive while reducing React re-renders

**Step 1.2: Implement State Update Batching**
- Create a `pendingStateUpdates` ref to collect changes
- Update React state every 50ms (20 FPS) to match game loop frequency
- Batch multiple tick results into single React state update
- Keep game logic running smoothly, synchronize UI updates with game updates

**Step 1.3: Optimize Performance Metrics Updates**
- Move performance metrics to refs instead of state
- Update metrics only when displayed (not every 60 frames)
- Add cleanup for performance monitoring

**Step 1.4: Memoize Expensive Calculations**
- Wrap `getPerSec`, `prestigePotential` calculations in `useMemo`
- Add dependency arrays to prevent unnecessary recalculations
- Test performance improvement with React DevTools Profiler

**Step 1.5: Optimize Tick Function**
- Reduce object creation in tick loop
- Use `useCallback` for tick function
- Implement early returns for unchanged states
- Ensure game logic runs at full speed (20-60 FPS) for smooth gameplay

**Important Note**: The goal is to keep the game running smoothly at minimum 20 FPS (50ms intervals) while optimizing React re-renders. Game logic and React state both update at 20 FPS (50ms intervals) to maintain synchronization. This ensures smooth gameplay and responsive UI updates while preventing unnecessary re-renders within the 50ms window. 20 FPS is the minimum acceptable frame rate for smooth idle game experience.

### 2. State Management Refactoring

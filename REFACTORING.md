# Refactoring Tasks for Medieval Kingdom

This document outlines the refactoring tasks identified in the codebase, organized by priority and difficulty.

## 🔴 High Priority (Critical Issues)

### 1. ✅ Deprecated Code Cleanup - COMPLETED
**Difficulty: Low (3-5 changes)**
- **Issue**: Legacy function exports in `actionValidation.ts` that are marked as deprecated
- **Location**: `src/lib/game/utils/actionValidation.ts`
- **Problem**: Deprecated functions still exist for backward compatibility but should be removed
- **Solution**: Update all callers to use the new `ActionValidator` class, then remove deprecated exports
- **Files to modify**: `actionValidation.ts`, update callers in other files

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **✅ Step 1**: Find all usages of deprecated functions - COMPLETED
   - Search for `canExecuteAction` calls in the codebase
   - Search for `isActionUnlocked` calls in the codebase
   - Document which files need updates

2. **✅ Step 2**: Update callers to use ActionValidator class - COMPLETED
   - Replace `canExecuteAction(state, actionKey)` with `ActionValidator.canExecuteAction(state, actionKey)`
   - Replace `isActionUnlocked(state, actionKey)` with `ActionValidator.isActionUnlocked(state, actionKey)`
   - Test each change individually

3. **✅ Step 3**: Remove deprecated exports - COMPLETED
   - Remove the deprecated function exports from `actionValidation.ts`
   - Remove the `@deprecated` comments
   - Test that all functionality still works

4. **✅ Step 4**: Clean up imports - COMPLETED
   - Update any files that were importing the deprecated functions
   - Ensure they import from the correct location

#### ✅ **Completion Summary:**
- **Files Modified**: `actions.ts`, `loopActionEngine.ts`, `ActionList.tsx`, `actionValidation.ts`

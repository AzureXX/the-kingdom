## üéØ Core Game Systems

### 1. Resource System
The game features 6 primary resources:

| Resource | Icon | Starting Amount | Description |
|----------|------|----------------|-------------|
| Gold | ü™ô | 10 | Primary currency for purchases |
| Wood | üå≤ | 0 | Basic building material |
| Stone | ü™® | 0 | Advanced building material |
| Food | üçñ | 0 | Sustains population and buildings |
| Prestige | üëë | 0 | Hidden resource for prestige upgrades |
| Research Points | üî¨ | 0 | Hidden resource for technology research |

### 2. Building System
8 unique buildings with different production and consumption patterns:

#### Basic Buildings
- **Woodcutter's Hut**: Produces Wood (1.2/s) - Cost: 15 Gold
- **Quarry**: Produces Stone (0.8/s) - Cost: 30 Gold, 5 Wood
- **Farm**: Produces Food (1.5/s) - Cost: 25 Gold, 8 Wood
- **Blacksmith**: Produces Gold (2.5/s), consumes Wood (0.3/s) and Stone (0.2/s) - Cost: 50 Gold, 15 Wood, 10 Stone

#### Advanced Buildings
- **Castle**: Produces Prestige (0.1/s), consumes Food (0.5/s) - Cost: 200 Gold, 50 Wood, 100 Stone, 20 Food
- **Library**: Produces Gold (1.0/s) and Research Points (0.1/s) - Cost: 100 Gold, 30 Wood, 20 Stone - Requires Writing technology
- **University**: Produces Gold (3.0/s), Prestige (0.05/s), and Research Points (0.3/s), consumes Food (1.0/s) - Cost: 300 Gold, 80 Wood, 60 Stone, 30 Food - Requires Writing and Mathematics
- **Laboratory**: Produces Gold (5.0/s), Prestige (0.1/s), and Research Points (0.5/s), consumes Food (2.0/s) - Cost: 500 Gold, 100 Wood, 150 Stone, 50 Food - Requires Chemistry and Engineering

### 3. Technology System
6 technologies that unlock advanced buildings and provide strategic depth:

| Technology | Cost | Research Time | Unlocks | Prerequisites |
|------------|------|---------------|---------|---------------|
| Writing | 50 Gold, 20 Wood | 30s | Library | None |
| Mathematics | 100 Gold, 30 Wood, 20 Stone | 60s | University | Writing |
| Engineering | 150 Gold, 50 Wood, 40 Stone | 90s | - | Writing, Mathematics |
| Chemistry | 200 Gold, 60 Wood, 50 Stone, 20 Food | 120s | Laboratory | Mathematics, Engineering |
| Physics | 300 Gold, 80 Wood, 70 Stone, 30 Food | 180s | - | Mathematics, Chemistry |
| Biology | 400 Gold, 100 Wood, 90 Stone, 50 Food | 240s | - | Chemistry, Physics |

### 4. Prestige System
Prestige is earned by resetting the game with accumulated Food. The formula is:
```
Prestige = sqrt(Total Food Generated / 1000)
```

Prestige can be spent on 4 permanent upgrades:

| Upgrade | Effect | Cost Formula | Max Level |
|---------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Royal Decrees | +25% click gains per level | 5 √ó 1.6^level | 20 |
| Master Craftsmen | -3% building costs per level | 8 √ó 1.7^level | 25 |
| Fertile Lands | +20% Food production per level | 6 √ó 1.65^level | 25 |
| Military Might | +20% Prestige production per level | 10 √ó 1.7^level | 20 |

### 5. Event System
Random events occur every 1-3 minutes, providing players with choices that affect resources:

#### Event Types
- **Merchant Visit**: Trade resources for Gold
- **Bandit Raid**: Lose resources or pay tribute
- **Bountiful Harvest**: Gain multiple resources
- **Drought**: Lose Food or accept reduced production
- **Royal Tax**: Pay Gold or lose Prestige
- **Mysterious Stranger**: Trade Gold for Prestige
- **Plague**: Lose Prestige or accept consequences
- **Festival**: Gain resources through celebration
